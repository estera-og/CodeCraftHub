/**
 * UserService tests
 *
 * Purpose
 *  - Demonstrate how to unit test the service layer in isolation.
 *  - In real usage you would mock the Mongoose model.
 *
 * Notes
 *  - This file is a placeholder with examples and commentary.
 *  - Replace the sample test with real cases in your project work.
